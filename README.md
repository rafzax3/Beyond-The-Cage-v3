Trapped in a shifting, endless corridor, a lost cat must spot what's wrong to find a way out.

Beyond The Cage is a 2D observation puzzle game with a tense, liminal atmosphere. You play as Lyx, a cat who has wandered into a mysterious building that won't let him leave. Or is it a memory he can't escape? He is stuck in a cycle, walking through the same familiar, unsettling rooms over and over.

But are they really the same?

HOW TO PLAY
This game is inspired by "The Exit 8," challenging your attention to detail.

OBSERVE: Pay close attention to your surroundings as you walk from room to room.
IDENTIFY: Look for "anomalies"—anything that is different, missing, or out of place.
CHOOSE YOUR PATH:
If the room is NORMAL, proceed to the RIGHT to advance.
If you spot an ANOMALY, you must turn back and go to the LEFT to advance.
ESCAPE: A correct choice brings you one step closer to freedom (Advance the clock from 12:00 PM to arrive at the final destination at 06:00 AM). A wrong choice sends you right back to the start of the loop.
Can you break the cycle, reach the final room, and guide Lyx to the true exit?

FEATURES
Mind-Bending Puzzles: A 2D "spot the difference" game that tests your memory and observation.
Tense Atmosphere: Combines the puzzle genre with creeping horror elements.
A Deeper Mystery: Why is Lyx here? The anomalies may be more than just glitches—they might be fragments of a past he thought he'd left behind.
Inspectable Objects: Uncover more about your strange surroundings.
Focused Controls: Full keyboard navigation for both the game and menus.
